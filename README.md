# ACuteMessagePerDay [SP]

+ **Category**: Personal Project
+ **Status**: Active

## **Overview**

This bot is a simple application thay automatically tweet a message to my girlfriend everyday.  
It picks a random sentence in a list and adds an emoji if needed and post it to tweeter at the rythm of one per day.

## **Goal / Requirements**

This was originally made for my girlfriend's birthday with no particular requirements.  
I just wanted it to send a message everyday at fixed hours.  

Potentially, I'd love to add more messages and more features such as cute images or respectful memes...

## **Technologies**

+ Python
+ Twitter API ([tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/))
